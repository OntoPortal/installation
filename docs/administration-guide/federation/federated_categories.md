# Federated Categories

All the portals in the federation now use a unified general disciplines vocabulary –the UNESCO Thesaurus– to describe each portal categories. This allows for an easier comparison of the disciplines covered by each portal and enables the filtering of ontologies by categories in multiple AgroPortal views.
Consequently, AgroPortal has now changed all its categories to follow this shared approach. We have picked up 41 categories (organized as top categories and sub categories) from the UNESCO Thesaurus and 1 from AGROVOC. These categories are shown in multiple views in AgroPortal with “shortnames” and are mostly used to: (i) assign categories when editing on ontology; (ii) select ontologies in Browse page or Advanced ontology selector.

We have re-assigned every ontologies or vocabularies in AgroPortal to those categories / disciplines. This work has been done mostly manually and is currently being curated, but we suggest ontology developers to double check if the new categories assigned to their resource are appropriate and/or if any other ones are missing. We welcome feedback on this new organization of AgroPortal’s categories and are expecting some adjustments in the months to come.
