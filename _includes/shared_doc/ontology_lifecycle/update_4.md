**Edit submission**

From this section, located at the bottom left corner, the {{ page.atom }} administrators can update the metadata of the latest submission by editing the information on the metadata form. {{ page.atom }} administrators can also replace the URL or the local file of the resource in case an error occurred during the original submission. Once the form is edited, click on the "Save Submission" button. If the "Location" settings are not changed,  only the metadata changes will be saved.
