# OntoPortal Federation

An {{site.opva}} can be federated with other ones enabling each portal to display some content from the others. Mostly, it suppports users to browse ontologies and search for classes and concepts across multiple federated portals. The OntoPortal Federation was firstly enabled in December 2024 as a joint release with AgroPortal, EcoPortal, EarthPortal and BiodivPortal. 


The OntoPortal Federation has multiple technical and collaborative dimensions summarized in this section.
