To access semantic artefacts programmatically, see our Resources REST API documentation.
In the browse page, the “Submit New semantic artefact” button is also available on the upper-left part of the page, but users need to be logged in to perform this operation.
For more information about publishing a new semantic artefact in {{ include.portal }}, please visit
the guide.
