# How to configure the documentation

To make it as easy as possible to write documentation in plain Markdown, most UI components are styled using default Markdown elements with few additional CSS classes needed.

If [Jekyll] is installed on your computer, you can build and preview the created site *locally*. This lets you test changes before committing them, and avoids waiting for GitHub Pages. And you will be able to deploy your local build to a different platform than GitHub Pages.
