**Edit settings**

From this section, located at the top right corner, the {{ page.atom }} administrators can change the settings of a {{ page.atom }} (e.g., name, administrators, viewing restrictions, categories, etc.). It is not possible to change the {{ page.atom }} acronym because {{ page.portal }} uses this field as a primary key and identifier.
