All the content that the {{ page.portal }} uses (and more!) is available via REST services by means users can:
- access all {{ page.portal }} {{ page.atoms }}, their different versions, and metadata for those versions;
- access information about any {{ page.atom }} concept in {{ page.portal }} (with definitions, synonyms, and other properties);
- search across all {{ page.atoms }} in {{ page.portal }};
- get hierarchy information for {{ page.portal }} {{ page.atoms }} (such as parents, children, or siblings of a class, roots or leaves of a class hierarchy).
