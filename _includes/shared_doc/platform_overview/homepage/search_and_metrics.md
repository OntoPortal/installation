The homepage contains the Search and Metrics section that allows to:
- quickly search for terms by entering a class name in the "Search for a class" bar;
- quickly search for {{ page.atoms }} by entering free text in the "Find a {{ page.atom }}" bar. The autocomplete functionality will support the quest by suggesting the {{ page.atom }} available with the portal.
- consult {{ page.portal }} metrics such as number of visits, number of resources published, number of classes, etc.
