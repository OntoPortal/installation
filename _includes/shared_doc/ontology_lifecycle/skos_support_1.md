### SKOS Support

**Support for SKOS vocabularies in {{page.portal}}**
{{ page.portal }} serves as a web-based portal designed for the access and exchange of {{include.atoms}}. The platform is capable of receiving {{include.atom}} submissions in OWL and OBO formats, as well as SKOS vocabularies containing specific constructs. This guide outlines the essential set of SKOS constructs required in a vocabulary for proper acceptance and handling within {{ page.portal }}. It is important to emphasise that the described SKOS constructs are specifically processed for vocabularies identified as SKOS during their submission to {{ page.portal }}.
