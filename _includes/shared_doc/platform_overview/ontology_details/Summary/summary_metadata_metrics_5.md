For more details about the metrics generation, please read [this](https://www.bioontology.org/wiki/Ontology_Metrics). {{ include.portal }} users will be able to access {{ include.atom }} metrics in two ways:
- through the {{ include.portal }} user interface, in the metrics area of the summary page (see example here);
- through a dedicated REST service that returns a JSON (see example below).
