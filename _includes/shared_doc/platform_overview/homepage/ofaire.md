Below the Search and Metrics section is displayed the Ontology FAIRness Evaluator (Oâ€™FAIRe) tool. This is a web service that performs an automatic FAIRness evaluation of {{ page.atoms }} by analysing metadata fields associated with particular questions corresponding to each FAIR principle and sub-principle. 
The tool automatically executes the tests and evaluates how the {{ page.atoms }} respond to the questions, providing a global normalised FAIR score associated with some basic statistics. To better understand which are the features of the tool and how the FAIRness evaluation is executed for each {{ page.atom }}, see [here](<docs/users-guide-docs/documentation/{{page.portal}}/Semantic artefact detail page/Summary/summary_ofaire.md>). To learn more about the tool please visit the related [GitHub page](https://github.com/agroportal/fairness).
