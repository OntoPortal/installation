Quality-Control and Quality-Assurance Metrics provide some indication of the quality of the {{ page.atom }} and help {{ page.atom }} authors to improve their quality. The maximum value allowed for all metrics is currently set to 200. Ontologies with more than 200 classes in a category will still have the total number of classes in that category counted, but no list will be available. Please notice that:
- Classes *With A Single Child*: a list of classes with only one subclass in the hierarchy. While technically there is no problem in having only one subclass, this situation often indicates that either the hierarchy is under-specified, or that the distinction between the class and the subclass is not appropriate;
- Classes *With More Than 25 Children*: a list of classes that have more than 25 direct subclasses. A class that has more than 25 subclasses could benefit of additional distinctions and categorization;
- Classes *With No Definition*: a list of classes that have no value for the definition property. For ontologies in OBO and RDRF formats, the property for definition is part of the language. For OWL ontologies, the authors specify this property as part of the ontology metadata (the default is "skos:definition").
