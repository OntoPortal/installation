# Getting Started 
The first page to see if you want to go beyond a sample installation of Ontoportal
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

After [installing OntoPortal]({{site.baseurl}}/administration/steps/), you will probably want to customize its UI or add new features.

For small changes, you can see [Branding Customizations]({{site.baseurl}}/administration/steps/branding-customizations) page, 
otherwise you will need to [set up your own local development environment]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/developers-docs/development-environment/) and [understand how OntoPortal works]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/developers-docs/global_architecture).
