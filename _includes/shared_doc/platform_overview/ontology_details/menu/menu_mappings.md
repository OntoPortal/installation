### Mappings
In the Mappings tab all the mappings of the selected {{ page.atom }} are displayed. The table includes two columns: {{ page.atom }} and Mappings. The first column identifies the {{ page.atom }} to which the selected resource is mapped, and the second column shows the number of mappings. By clicking on a {{ page.atom }} all the mappings are shown.
