EarthPortal is a catalog of thematic semantic artefacts and a semantic repository intended for Earth
sciences based on OntoPortal technology and supported by the [Data Terra](https://www.data-terra.org/) research infrastructure.
Developed within the EOSC FAIR-IMPACT project, its implementation adheres to national and
European recommendations, aiming to enhance the dissemination and reuse of semantic artefacts
in an interdisciplinary research context. EarthPortal also ensures the traceability and recognition of
the authorship of vocabularies, thus offering better recognition for their creators. At the European
level, the recommendations of the "Semantic Interoperability" Task Force emphasize the importance
of recognizing catalogs of semantic artefacts (as described in the interoperability framework of the
European Open Science Cloud - EOSC) as a crucial element for the long-term sustainability of any
research data infrastructure.
